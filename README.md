A plugin for ksysguard that provides NVIDIA GPU sensors, personal use.

## Note to vistors
This was written while I am in the process of learning Go.\
There may be bugs, security vulnerabilities, etc... as this project is intended for personal use, don't expect for me to add additional sensors, fix issues or maintain the project for the far future.\
I won't specify build instructions because of this, figure it out by yourself.
